Strange behaviour with TextField optionals

This app uses techniques seen on Donny Wals YouTube "Using Core Data in a Modern SwiftUI Application"

When used on my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS15.7 this app works as expected.
When loaded onto my iPhone 13 Pro Max running iOS16.0.2,
the textfield for Description behaves strangely allowing only 1 character to be input.

Checkout SpeakerEditView for the differences in the way the fields are presented and handled.

Is this a bug?
Can I remedy the behaviour?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
